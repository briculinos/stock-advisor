```

---

## How to Use

### 1. Test the Scoring System

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/code/stockhints/backend
npx tsx test-moonshot-scoring.ts
```

This will analyze TSLA, GME, and NVDA, showing:
- Total moonshot score (0-100)
- Grade (S, A, B, C, D, F)
- Category (High/Moderate/Low Potential)
- Risk level
- Component breakdown
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Detailed recommendation

### 2. Integrate into API

The moonshot scoring is already integrated into the stock research flow. To use programmatically:

```typescript
import { StockResearchService } from './src/services/stockResearchService.js';
import { MoonshotScoringService } from './src/services/moonshotScoringService.js';

const researchService = new StockResearchService();
const scoringService = new MoonshotScoringService();

// Get research data
const researchData = await researchService.researchStock('TSLA');

// Calculate moonshot score
const moonshotScore = scoringService.calculateMoonshotScore(researchData);

console.log(`Moonshot Score: ${moonshotScore.totalScore}/100`);
console.log(`Grade: ${moonshotScore.grade}`);
console.log(`Recommendation: ${moonshotScore.recommendation}`);
```

### 3. Add to Frontend

The moonshot score can be displayed in your frontend using the existing stock analysis endpoints. The score object includes:

```typescript
{
  totalScore: number,      // 0-100
  grade: 'S' | 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D' | 'F',
  category: string,        // "High Potential" | "Moderate Potential" | etc.
  riskLevel: string,       // "Very High" | "High" | "Medium" | "Low"
  components: {
    rumorsAndPolitics: { score, details, factors },
    newsImpact: { score, details, factors },
    socialSentiment: { score, details, factors },
    insiderActivity: { score, details, factors }
  },
  strengths: string[],
  weaknesses: string[],
  recommendation: string
}
```

## Example Output (Current State)

With only Marketaux working, scores are low (F grade) because:
- No congressional trading data (50% weight missing)
- No social sentiment data (15% weight missing)
- No insider activity data (10% weight missing)
- Only basic news impact (25% weight, partially working)

**Sample Output:**
```
üéØ MOONSHOT SCORE: 1/100 [Grade: F]
üìà Category: Not a Moonshot
‚ö†Ô∏è  Risk Level: Low

üìã SCORE BREAKDOWN:

   1Ô∏è‚É£  Rumors + Politics + Tariffs: 0/50 (50% weight)

       ‚Ä¢ Negative Marketaux sentiment: -28% (0 points)
       ‚Ä¢ Low news volume: 3 articles (+1 point)

   3Ô∏è‚É£  Social Sentiment: 0/15 (15% weight)

## Technical Details

### API Rate Limits

- **Marketaux Free Tier:** 10,000 requests/month
- **Alpha Vantage (RapidAPI):** Depends on subscription tier
- **Quiver Quantitative:** Check account limits
- **Yahoo Finance:** No official limits (use caching to avoid abuse)

### Caching Strategy

The system includes intelligent caching:
- Price data: 15-minute cache
- News data: Fetched on-demand (not cached)
- Research data: Generated fresh per request
- Moonshot scores: Calculated real-time (can add caching if needed)

### Error Handling

The system gracefully handles API failures:
- If Marketaux fails ‚Üí falls back to Brave/SerpAPI
- If Quiver fails ‚Üí continues without political data
- If Alpha Vantage fails ‚Üí continues without professional sentiment
- Scoring algorithm works with partial data
